    "The V-measure is the harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness, balancing both metrics.\n",
    "Different Values:\n",
    "Yes, homogeneity and completeness can have different values for the same clustering result. A clustering result can be very homogeneous but not complete, or vice versa, depending on how well the clusters capture the true underlying class structure.\n",

    "Calculate the Silhouette Coefficient for each clustering algorithm on the same dataset.\n",
    "Compare the coefficients to determine which algorithm provides the best clustering quality.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Silhouette Coefficient assumes clusters are convex and well-separated, which may not be true for all datasets.\n",
    "Different algorithms may perform better for different types of cluster structures, so the Silhouette Coefficient should be used alongside other metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "Perform hierarchical clustering on the dataset.\n",
    "Choose a level of the dendrogram to cut and obtain a specific number of clusters.\n",
